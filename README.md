# vchmod

This is a record of passing. 

Les Czegel was a fantastic professor with a really cracked idea of what constituted a useful scripting test. Did this test us? Yes. Was it challenging? Yes. Was it in any way useful to my career outside past this point? 

I mean. I've used `tput` like twice so... enh?

Anyways. I've long since lost the assignment sheet for this thing, but the tl;dr is that you were supposed to create a visual interface for chmod. Given the quality of teaching at Seneca and its students, conniving professors might try to use Les' work to bulk out their class or just... write the course for them. In which case, interested students should feel free to use this script because lazy is as lazy does and the mark of a talented admin is getting someone else to do the work for them.

Hell, you should feel free to use it anyways. :pirate_flag:
